# Linear Regression
My intention by writing this code was to study the probably more basic machine learning algorithm, the linear regression. As you can see in the notebook named 'main.ipynb' that contains all of the mainly code, I've written all in Python and didn't use any machine learning library to assist. Instead, I've written all from scratch and used libraries only to auxiliate the data manipulation and visualization, like 'pandas' and 'matplotlib'.
